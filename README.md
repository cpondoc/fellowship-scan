![Fellowship](public/fellowship.png)

The Fellowship Scan allows members of the Tellor community to track activity on the Fellowship and Mesophere smart contracts. 

Created by: Christopher Pondoc.

## Overview
Similar to Tellor Scan, the Fellowship Scan allows users to have the following functionality:
* Keep track of real-time price data
* Look at past reporter history, detailed with addresses and values submitted
* Analyze historical price data

In addition, the dashboard provides commentary on what the different parts of the Fellowship and Mesosphere contract entail in the context of their value.

## Getting Started
